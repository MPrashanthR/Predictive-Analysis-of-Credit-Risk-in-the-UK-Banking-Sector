Predictive Analysis of Credit Risk in the UK Banking Sector: A Machine  Learning Approach to Macroeconomic Determinants 


This project explores how macroeconomic factors influence credit risk in the UK banking sector. Using statistical and machine learning models, particularly a high-performing decision tree with 95% accuracy, the study identifies key predictors of non-performing loans, such as inflation, unemployment, and national savings. The findings provide actionable insights for developing early warning systems and guiding credit risk management strategies in UK banks.

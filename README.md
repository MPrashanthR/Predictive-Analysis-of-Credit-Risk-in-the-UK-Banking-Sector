Predictive Analysis of Credit Risk in the UK Banking Sector: A Machine  Learning Approach to Macroeconomic Determinants 


This project explores how macroeconomic factors influence credit risk in the UK banking sector. Using statistical and machine learning models, particularly a high-performing decision tree with 95% accuracy, the study identifies key predictors of non-performing loans, such as inflation, unemployment, and national savings. The findings provide actionable insights for developing early warning systems and guiding credit risk management strategies in UK banks.


Approach :
We are looking at the problem from the conservative investor's standpoint -- we are more interested in a low False Positive Rate(FPR) than a high True Positive Rate(TPR)

Goal:
Construct a machine learning model that achieves a TPR greater than 50% while maintaining a FPR less than 7%.
